- Investigate createRecord calls sans the key property (relations don't get set if not provided)

  [DONE] Maurits found that SC does not handle custom setting of primaryKey, while not providing a
  declaration in the model for id: SC.Record.attr(String);, so this is now provided, and the key is also
  now removed from all createRecord calls.

- After a batch of records has been created, in the next phase of record creation, there is a search
  for READY records within the batch that are to be set in toMany relations for the next record type
  (After reviews have been created, and a given version is created next, reviews pertaining to the
  version are found and set in the version's toMany for reviews). The record search was attempted by
  using a store query, but this caused a bucket prototype error, so there is a manual loop and insertion
  into a local array. Reconsider the store query way. See authors controller for current way and for
  commented-out code.

- Test and fix basic ops, for adding, deleting, etc.

  [DONE] Forms and proper findings were added to book view, and fixes made to fields in the forms.

- Add info to README about installation and running ONR, Riak.

- Get label dividers to work in the book form. They show up as blank intervals if added as is now.

- Evaluate the layout of the book form. Labels are needed for the lists, for the form. If design with version list
  left, form on right, reviews list on bottom, kept, handle case of small window size and overlap of reviews list and
  main  properties panel.

- Add all editable book data to the book view (title, author, etc.).

  [DONE]

- Fix editing of form items. Code from Contacts app, in book.js, to set beginEditing() on the form fails with error
  about beginEditing not being in SC.FormView. Do you only have to set isEditing? And what about the default setting?

  [DONE]

- Animation in the Contacts app works for forms, but doesn't in here yet. I saw someone in IRC remark about the live
  Contacts app, "Too much motion." Evaluate the use of animation here. Doesn't it make forms less boring? But is it
  too much for use on a regular basis (Even if a user liked it in the beginning, wouldn't they get tired of it?). What
  about a setting for turning animation on and off?

- Make the versions and reviews list have the first item selected on load.

  [DONE]

- Add delete for a book, in the bottom toolbar with a - icon? or, with a dedicated button when Edit activated?

- Style long reviews... For text wrapping, with css?  by putting \ns in the text?

- Style lists, period. The Contacts app has code for odd/even, which is in here, but not working.

- Add hints to text fields. Are labels needed?

  [DONE] Labels were kept (they are automatic when using autoload through bindings).

- Add introduction panel on what to watch, and what reports to expect, when running.

- Add feedback for actions happening with ONR, for initial load (partially done), and for principal actions, such as
  add, delete, etc. Somewhere add feedback on relation-setting, perhaps when a new record is added.

- Fix label cutting off in books list. Make wider, but handle long titles with... ellipsis?

- Rename versions to editions?

- Add ops buttons to add reviews. Reviews are now attached to versions. Should they be attached to books?

- Add more book data. Add media versions... How to handle missing fields in that case, e.g., no page numbers.

- Review theming, which is now some combination of that from the Contacts app and a few things from test_controls app.
  Redo everything with the Ace theme, ala test_controls?

- Add a view for picking favorites using a linkit-demo type panel (SCUI), for testing and showing relations-setting.

- Add torture test data, perhaps with python program that emits fake data.

- Add responder-based app control (aka, statecharts). Use test_controls as a model? Use Ki?

- Add tests. Use Lebowski?
